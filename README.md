# ðŸ’° Bank Account Management System (Java)

This is a simple Java project I created to practice Object-Oriented Programming. It simulates basic bank operations like depositing money, withdrawing, and checking your balance â€” all from the command line.

It's a beginner-level project but really helped me understand how classes, objects, and methods work together in Java.
